# arduino-mcp2515-simulink
A documentation on how to use CAN on Arduino with Simulink
Hardware Required : 
Arduino with SPI interface(Arduino Uno or Arduino Mega, I used Arduino Mega)
MCP2515 CAN transceiver. (get the SPI model)
Jumper Wire
A usb to CAN send and receive with a software for debug (PCAN,VectorCAN or CANable V2.0. CANable V2.0 is what I am using with cangaroo)
Matlab and Simulink

Setup the wiring
